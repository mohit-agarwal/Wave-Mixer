README

The project designs an interface with following functionalities:

1. Amplitude Scaling : Given a wave­form you have to scale with certain amount.

2. Time Shift : Given a wave­form shift it along time axis.

3. Time Scaling : Given a wave­from scale it along time axis.

4. Time reversal : Reverse the wave along time axis.

5. Mixing : Set certain values (mentioned above) for each wave selected and then mix them to get another wave as output.

6. Modulation : Set certain values for each wave selected and then modulate them to get another wave as output.


How to use
